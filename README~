You will need the PyQt4 packages: sudo apt-get install python-qt4
and the python-qsintilla2 bindings to use PyTe: sudo apt-get install python-qscintills2

pyte.py is the main app, simply navigate to the folder containing pyte.py in a terminal and run either
./pyte.py
or
python pyte.py
both should work fine.

web.py was a test that i was doing on building the web browser tabs. it is no longer needed or used.

config.cfg is the config file, it holds the color settings for the code editor
