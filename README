Please report bugs to: https://github.com/JoshAshby/PyTe/issues

To use PyTe:
Make sure you have the latest PyQT bindings, and the Python-scintilla bindings. Download the latest version, untar it (gui or with tar -xf) and run (again with the gui although you may have to set the permissions to 'allow execution as program' or something similar (chmod 755 should work)) double click pyte.py or run in a terminal with working directory as the download and ./pyte.py or python pyte.py. Enjoy!
