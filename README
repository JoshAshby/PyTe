You will need the PyQt4 packages: sudo apt-get install python-qt4
and the python-qsintilla2 bindings to use PyTe: sudo apt-get install python-qscintills2

pyte.py is the main app, simply navigate to the folder containing pyte.py in a terminal and run either
./pyte.py
or
python pyte.py
both should work fine.

web.py was a test that i was doing on building the web browser tabs. it is no longer needed or used.

config.cfg is the config file, it holds the color settings for the code editor

PyTe.tar.gz is PyTe v1, this is a version written in PyQt3, and uses a lot more stuff. A few features from him have been carried over to the new PyTe v2, and a few features have been removed for the time being. Figured I throw it in here as I started development before I got on github, and never got a repo setup for it.

#PyTe, or Python Text Editor as he started off being named, is
#a semi advanced code editor that i have been writting for the
#past several years. He uses the PyQt4 gui library, and is meant
#to be somewhat stand alone.
#he includes a qtwebkit web browser as i have found having a
#browser and a code editor in the same window to be helpful
