You will need the PyQt4 packages: sudo apt-get install python-qt4
and the python-qsintilla2 bindings to use PyTe: sudo apt-get install python-qscintills2

pyte.py is the main app, simply navigate to the folder containing pyte.py in a terminal and run either
./pyte.py
or
python pyte.py
both should work fine.

web.py was a test that i was doing on building the web browser tabs. it is no longer needed or used.

config.cfg is the config file, it holds the color settings for the code editor

#PyTe, or Python Text Editor as he started off being named, is
#a semi advanced code editor that i have been writting for the
#past several years. He uses the PyQt4 gui library, and is meant
#to be somewhat stand alone.
#he includes a qtwebkit web browser as i have found having a
#browser and a code editor in the same window to be helpful
