You will need the PyQt4 packages: sudo apt-get install python-qt4
and the python-qsintilla2 bindings to use PyTe: sudo apt-get install python-qscintills2

pyte.py is the main app, simply navigate to the folder containing pyte.py in a terminal and run either
./pyte.py
or
python pyte.py
both should work fine.

config.cfg is the config file, it holds the color settings for the code editor

PyTe.tar.gz is PyTe v1, this is a version written in PyQt3, and uses a lot more stuff. A few features from him have been carried over to the new PyTe v2, and a few features have been removed for the time being. Figured I throw it in here as I started development before I got on github, and never got a repo setup for it.

#PyTe, or Python Text Editor as he started off being named, is
#a semi advanced code editor that i have been writting for the
#past several years. He uses the PyQt4 gui library, and is meant
#to be somewhat stand alone.
#he includes a qtwebkit web browser as i have found having a
#browser and a code editor in the same window to be helpful
